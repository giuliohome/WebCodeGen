# WebCodeGen
Code Generation. 
F# to create F# web code, my way: producing only repetitive parts. 

The final clean source will be, as usual, in a separated managed project, under Visual Studio, with all the typed, controlled, classical features. 

This is just the practical, business oriented, F# interpretation of Haskell "Generics", translated into a mix of some parser, lexer, code generation and related abstractions.
